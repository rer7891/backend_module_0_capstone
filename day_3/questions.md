## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

* if 5 > 2 puts "5 is greater than 2."
* unless num == 5 puts "That number is not 5."
* while animal == "Fox" puts "Foxes are awesome!"

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

if statements are useful when you have conditions that need
to be met in order to do something. Sometimes there can be multiple options with multiple outcomes in which case you can use if, elsif, and else to create those options.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

if (conditional) <br>
  "do this" <br>
end

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

if (conditional) <br>
  "do this" <br>
elsif (conditional) <br>
  "do this" <br>
else (conditional) <br>
  "do this" <br>
end

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?

if <br>
elsif <br>
else <br>
end

You can have as many elsif statements as you want but only one if and only one else statement. They always need to finish with an end statement.


1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

While or Unless can be used when making conditional loops.
