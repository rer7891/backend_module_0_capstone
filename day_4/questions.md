## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
It allows you to write chunks of code that when called will do something. They
also allow you to pass arguments and variables to the code which can then return
a value.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

def hello <br>
puts "Sam I am" <br>
end <br>

puts hello

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

def hello_someone(name) <br>
 puts "#{name} I am" <br>
end <br>

hello_someone("Sam")

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

hello_someone("Sam")

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?

Why did one of the lesson plans refer to them as functions?
